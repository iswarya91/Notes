* HTML - Hyper Text Markup Language.
* It defines the nouns of the webpage. It gives the bare skeleton or structure for a web page.
* In was introduced in early 1990s to give structure to sceintific documents. Due to its simplicity, itdecame highl popular and became a standard for web 
   development.
* HTML standard is maintained by w3c (world wide web consortium)
* HTML defines a structure to the content simply by ensclosing the content within the tag. An HTML tag begin with '<' and end with '>' eg: <h1>.
* Though html tags work with both lower and uppercase, it recommended by w3c to use lowercase.
* All HTML documents should have the following basic structure.
	* <!DOCTYPE html> - This should be the first line of the html document and tells the broweser that the document is of type HTML5. Earlier (before HTML5
	  we used to spevcify DTD (Document type definition) links in the <!DOCTYPE>
	* <html> - This is the root element and all elements should be enclosed with the <html> starting and </html> closing tag. It is mandatory to have <head>
	  and <body> element inside html.
	* <head> - This is the metadata information for the document and the content in it is not displayed. It mainly contain <title> and links to stylesheet and 
	  javascript. <head> tag is required to have a <title> tag.
		* <title> - This is the title of the web page. Though it is not displayed on the web page, the title is
			* displayed in tab in browser
			* used and displayed by search engine eg: google search 
	* <body> - This is the actual content of the webpage and displayed as part of web page.
	* Thus a basic HTML doc should contain 
		<!DOCTYPE html>
		<html>
			<head>
				<title>
				</title>
			</head>
			<body>
			</body>
		</html>
* HTML has many elements and a complete reference can be found in MDN element refrence. They can divided at a high level into two categories:
	* block - block level elements take there own line eg: h1, p etc
	* inline - inline elements are added as part of content and is added inline. eg: strong, em ,etc.
* HTML comments - Comments are ignored by the browser. The are enclosed with <!--  add comment here -->	
* Some common HTML elements are:
	* Block level elements:
		* Heading elements: HTML provides six levels of heading <h1>, <h2> ,..., <h6> , where <h1> is the most important heading and <h6> is the least 
		important.
		* <p> - Paragraph elements considers the ontent enclosed with as a pragraph and provides spacing identation etc.
		* Lists - HTML provides two types of lists:
			* ordered list - A numbered list is an example of ordered list. <ol> 
			* underordered list - An unordred list is where each list item is specified using bullet points.<ul>
			* Both <ol> and <ul> should contain list item . Each list item is enclosed within <li> tag.
			* A list can be nested to have a list within a list
		* <div> - It provides a container to group a set of elements together. There is no visible difference, but they are highly useful for styling
		  a group of elements diffenently using css. 
	* Inline elements:	
		* <strong> - To make some content appear stronger. The browsers usually bolds the content enclosed by <strong> tag. Earlier there used to be <b>
		  tag but it is deprecated .
		* <em> - It is used to emphasis a text content. It is recommended to be used in place <i> which is also deprecated. HTML5 deprecated <b> and <i>
		  tags as they wanted clear differentiation between sematics and styling as <b> and <i> are more to do with styling than sematics, these tags are
		  deprecated.
		* <span> - It is used to group a set of inline content or elements. There is no visible difference, but span is very useful along with
		  css to style a group of inline content eg: style a part of para using different color.
		* <img> - It is used to add an image to the web page. The imae source is provided using src attribute.eg: <img src="dog.png">
		* <a> - It is used to add a link in the html document. The link can be internal, another part of the same page or external a different page in the
		  system or web. eg: <a href="http://www.google.com">Google</a>
* <div> and <span> are used to group elements, while <div> is used to group block level elements, <span> is used to group inline elements.
* HTML attributes are used to specify addition information in tags. The html attributes are specified as name/value pair inside a html tag. eg: id="dev1"
	* All attributes cannot be applied to all elements. Usually they can be applied to only a few elements or even single html elements. The entire list
	  of HTML attributes and tags they can be applied to can be found in MDN attribute refrerence. 
	* Some commonly used attribute:
		* src - It can be used to provide a source to an image. It can content both http link to the image or local image. By default it looks at the current
          location if only file name is provided (relative path). To point an image on net the complete path with http://-> protocol should be specified
		  eg: <img src="dog.png">
		* href - It is used to provide a link in <a> tag. It also can both point to another file / document in the system or external http
		  link. It can also point to different part of the same document. eg: <a href="http://www.google.com">Google</a>
* Some tags do not require a closing tag. These are called self closing tag. eg <img>, <input> etc
* HTML Tables
	* Tables are created in HTML using <table> element. The HTML <table> element represents tabular data — that is, information presented in a two-dimensional 
	   table comprised of rows and columns of cells containing data.It can contain <thead> , <tbody> and <tfoot>. 
	* <thead> - This is the header of the table. It is optional. It contains the header element. The header row <tr> is added here with <th>
		<th> - Header element
	* <tbody> - The main content of table. It contains one or more rows <tr>
		<tr> - Table row
		<td> Table data
	* <tfoot> - The footer of the table.
	* <thead> , <tbody> and <tfoot> were added to give more structure to the table. A table can be created by simply using <tr> , <th> and <td> elements, But
	  it is good practice to divide table to <thead>, <tbody> and <tfoot> as it is the recommended approach.
* HTML Forms:
	* forms are added to html using form tag. It has two main attributes 
		* action: It is the url where the form data is sent. By default if no action is given it is submitted to same page. 
		* method: http method used to send data (get/post)
			* get is used to query an retrive data (eg: google) i.e On click of search some data is retreived from backend
			* post is used to send data to database eg: sign-up page - User data is added to database
	* Forms contain <input> tags to get user input. The type attribute of the <input> tag determines the type of input. 
	* Some of the common attributes of input tag are:
		* type: Type of the input Some common example of input type attribute values are text, email, password, radio, checkbox, color, submit ... etc
		  eg: <input type="text">
		* placeholder : It is placeholder string displayed till user gives a value
		* name: It is name of the input sent to the server. If name attribute is given we can see the query string sent in the URL on form submit.
		* id: gives an id to the input element.
		* value: Specify the value to be sent to the server
		* pattern: The pattern attribute specifies a regular expression that the <input> element's value is checked against. Note: The pattern attribute works 
		  with the following input types: text, date, search, url, tel, email, and password. Use the global title attribute to describe the pattern to
		  help the user.
	* A button as the last item of form can be used to submit the form. <input type="submit"> can be used alternately in place of the button.
	* <label> - It is the caption to each of the input field. Lables are used to make form more accesible.  It is important for screen readers as they can 
	  easily associate label with the input while reading the screen for blind people for example. There are two value to add table:
		* <input> is nested inside the <label> tag.
			<label>Username: <input type="text"></label>
			This approach is useful when there is a single lable for more than 1 input.
		* Another approach is to have <label> and <input> is given separately and they are connected using for attribute in label tag and id attribute in input tag.
			<label for="username">Username</label>
			<input id="username" type="text">
	* Validation: We can do basic validation in HTML. For advanced validation we need JS and backend. Two types of validations that can be done in HTML
		* Required - Makes the input mandatory. It is done using required boolean attribute to input. Boolean attribute are specified in HTML5 in one of
		the three ways:
			<input type="text" required>
			<input type="text" required="">
			<input type="text" required="required">
		All the three indicate a true value and absence indicate a false value. It required attribute is present it does not allow as submit a form until 
		the value is present for the input.
		* Type validation- Validates the user given input corresponds to the type of the input. eg: validates that @ is present in type="email"
	* Checkbox: Checkbox is added using type="checkbox" in input tag. Checkboxes are used to select multiple values. It can selected and unselected.
	  <input tye="checkbox">. In order check a checkbox by default, the checked boolean attribute can be used.
	* Radio Button: Radio button groups are added to select only one of many choices. eg: gender in a form. A single radio button is added using type="radio"
	  in the input tag. <input type="radio">. Two or more radio buttons are added and are grouped together using the same name. In order to send proper value 
	  to the backend value attribute needs to added.
		eg: <input name="pet" id="cat" value="CAT" type="radio">
		    <input name="pet" id="dog" value="DOG" type="radio">
	   Now user is allowed to select only one radio and on form sumit the value is sent sent as pet=DOG or pet=CAT, if no value attribute is given. It is 
	   sent as pet=on
	* Drop down: Drop down menu is added using <select> tag. name attribute is used in select tag to give name to the dropdown menu. We can add options
	  in the drop down menu using <option> tag. We can give value attribute to the option tag to specify the value to be send in http request if that option
	  is selected in the dropdown.
	  <select name="pet">
		<option value="dog">Dog</option>
		<option value="dog">Dog</option>
	  </select>
	 * Text area: It is used to give multi line input. <textarea>. The HTML <textarea> element represents a multi-line plain-text editing control, useful when you 
	   want to allow users to enter a sizeable amount of free-form text, for example a comment on a review or feedback form. We can define the size of textarea using
	   row and column attribute in textarea. <textarea rows="10" cols="50">Enter the desired feedback</textarea>. Default text is entered between tags.
* style -> <style> tag can be used to include css styles in the html document. It encloses css content and is part of <head> section.
  style attribute can be added to each element to give inline style eg: <h1 style="color:red">. Both are not recommended, css needs to be a separate sheet 
  and a link needs to given in html using <link> tag.
* <link> -> The HTML <link> element specifies relationships between the current document and an external resource. This element is most commonly used to link
  to stylesheets. eg: <link href="main.css" rel="stylesheet"> . There are a number of other common types you'll come across. For example, a link to the site's favicon:
  <link rel="icon" href="favicon.ico">
* <nav> -> The <nav> tag defines a set of navigation links. Notice that NOT all links of a document should be inside a <nav> element. The <nav> element is 
  intended only for major block of navigation links. Browsers, such as screen readers for disabled users, can use this element to determine whether to omit 
  the initial rendering of this content. It is part of HTML5.
* data-* attribute - HTML5 is designed with extensibility in mind for data that should be associated with a particular element but need not have any defined meaning.
 data-* attributes allow us to store extra information on standard, semantic HTML elements without other hacks such as non-standard attributes, extra properties
 on DOM, or Node.setUserData(). 
	The syntax is simple. Any attribute on any element whose attribute name starts with data- is a data attribute. Say you have an article and you want to 
	store some extra information that doesn’t have any visual representation. Just use data attributes for that:

		<article
			id="electriccars"
			data-columns="3"
			data-index-number="12314"
			data-parent="cars">
			...
		</article>
	* Reading the values of these attributes out in JavaScript is also very simple. You could use getAttribute() with their full HTML name to read them, 
	  but the standard defines a simpler way: a DOMStringMap you can read out via a dataset property.
	* To get a data attribute through the dataset object, get the property by the part of the attribute name after data- (note that dashes are 
	  converted to camelCase).
	 
	 var article = document.getElementById('electriccars');
 
	article.dataset.columns // "3"
	article.dataset.indexNumber // "12314"
	article.dataset.parent // "cars"
* <script> - This tag is used to add script such as javascript to html doc. When we use asyn attribute with the script tag, then it will load simulataneously 
  along with other assets on the page.
* <canvas> - <canvas> is an HTML element which can be used to draw graphics using scripting (usually JavaScript). This can, for instance, be used to draw graphs, make
 photo composition or simple (and not so simple) animations. The images on this page show examples of <canvas> implementations which will be created in this
 tutorial.
