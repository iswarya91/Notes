* Authentication is the means by which 
	* we verify sign in a new user, 
	* login a user to his account, 
	* prevent users who are not logged in from accessing their account
	* logout a user 
* Thus authentication is basic requirement for any commercial web application.
* User and password details cannot be directly stored in database. HEnce comes the need for authentication.
* HTTP is a stateless protocol i.e it does not remember its stateless or store any information about previous requests.. Sessions are a way to introduce a state
  to our http request. In a session some secret information is shared along with each http request part of a session. This secret info is decoded by the 
  server and used to identify that the request is part of the session. This secret info is not sent once the session is expired.
* HTTP is stateless; in order to associate a request to any other request, you need a way to store user data between HTTP requests. Cookies and URL 
  parameters are both suitable ways to transport data between the client and the server. But they are both readable and on the client side. Sessions
  solve exactly this problem. You assign the client an ID and it makes all further requests using that ID. Information associated with the client is 
  stored on the server linked to this ID.
* Thus a new session is created everytime a user logs in and destroyed when a user logs out.
* Also, sometimes when user is inactive for a  log time session may time out and user may have login again to create another session.
