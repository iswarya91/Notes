* WordPress is a free and open-source content management system (CMS) based on PHP and MySQL.
* Features include a plugin architecture and a template system. It is most associated with blogging, but supports other types of web content including more 
  traditional mailing lists and forums, media galleries, and online stores. 
* It is used by more than 60 million websites, including 30.6% of the top 10 million websites as of April 2018.
* WordPress is the most popular website management system in use.
* Plugins can be used to extend the functionality of the wordpress and custom themes can be installed to change the look and feel of the web site. It can be
  changed anytime without losing any of our work.
* Advantages of WordPress:
	* It is free and open source and has a large community.
	* It has a great WYSIWYG(What You See Is What You Get) Editor i.e a very powerful word processing editor.
	* It can handle different types of media.
	* It is very powerful and search engine friendly and makes managing your website very easy.
	* It is safe, secure and flexible for any type of site and it is also mobile frendly.
	* It is stable and mature as it has been around since early 2003.
* We need to install wordpress on a web host to create website that will be available to all.
* We use wordpress dashborad to design website in wordpress.
* There are two different versions of wordpress:
	* wordpress.com - It is service that allows us to crete website online. But it is cutdown version of wordpress and not a full version of wordpress.
		* It has different plans free as well as paid versions. One of main disadvantage of free version of wordpress is that it has adds which cannot be
		  turned off.Also it just gives only a subdomain not our own domain.	
	* wordpress.org - This is the full version of wordpress that can be installed locally or on a web host. It does not have any limitation. Though
	  the source code is same for all, if we intsall plugins or custom theme it changes the wordpress dashborad and available options. Screen options will
	  also change based plugins installed.
* WordPress Installation:
	* Local: 
		* Your site will not be visible to visitors, search engines or anyone else.  It will be 100% private on your computer
		* Need to have local server for wordpress in lical system like ServerPress:
			* ServerPress: DesktopServer software makes your local installation of WordPress as easy as simply giving your site a name and clicking 
			 a few buttons. There is free as well as premium version of DesktopServer available in ServerPress.
			* We need to download free DesktopServer suitable for system and unzip the file and install it. During installation you have an issue if
			  some other software is using port 8080. In that case we need to free up the port and continue with our installation.
			  (we can use ServerPress cports software to find the process running on different ports)
			* Once the ServerPress is installed, we will have DesktopServer.exe file. To start ServerPress we need to run this exe with administrator 
			  priviledge. During starting the server, we need to disable our antivirus as it may prevent us from writing to etc/host file.
			* Then in the wizard, we need give appropriate details and create a new web site. We need to give few details and set username/password for the 
			  wordpress site. Then wordpress will be installed. We can login to get the dashbord.
		* To get login page we can use either /wp-admin or /wp-login in site url.
		* To close the wordpress site, we need to log out of the site and also stop the server. We need to restart DesktopServer.exe(need to turn off antivirus
		  while starting) and visit the site and login.
	* Webhost:
		* When creating website in web host, first thing we need to do is find an available domain. We can do that by coming up with some domain names for 
		  our website and identifying which one is available using Domain Name Analyzer software. It saves time when Brainstorming Domain Names.
		* It is recommended to register with a separate registrar to buy a domain name like goDaddy, nameCheap etc. After getting the domain which cost money
		  and host the website using a web host like heroku, stable host etc. In the web hosting, we need not register the domain with host, but let it use
		  registrar to manage the domain and hosting is managed by the web site.
