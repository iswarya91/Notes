* WordPress is a free and open-source content management system (CMS) based on PHP and MySQL.
* Features include a plugin architecture and a template system. It is most associated with blogging, but supports other types of web content including more 
  traditional mailing lists and forums, media galleries, and online stores. 
* It is used by more than 60 million websites, including 30.6% of the top 10 million websites as of April 2018.
* WordPress is the most popular website management system in use.
* Plugins can be used to extend the functionality of the wordpress and custom themes can be installed to change the look and feel of the web site. It can be
  changed anytime without losing any of our work.
* Advantages of WordPress:
	* It is free and open source and has a large community.
	* It has a great WYSIWYG(What You See Is What You Get) Editor i.e a very powerful word processing editor.
	* It can handle different types of media.
	* It is very powerful and search engine friendly and makes managing your website very easy.
	* It is safe, secure and flexible for any type of site and it is also mobile frendly.
	* It is stable and mature as it has been around since early 2003.
* We need to install wordpress on a web host to create website that will be available to all.
* We use wordpress dashborad to design website in wordpress.
* There are two different versions of wordpress:
	* wordpress.com - It is service that allows us to crete website online. But it is cutdown version of wordpress and not a full version of wordpress.
		* It has different plans free as well as paid versions. One of main disadvantage of free version of wordpress is that it has adds which cannot be
		  turned off.Also it just gives only a subdomain not our own domain.	
	* wordpress.org - This is the full version of wordpress that can be installed locally or on a web host. It does not have any limitation. Though
	  the source code is same for all, if we intsall plugins or custom theme it changes the wordpress dashborad and available options. Screen options will
	  also change based plugins installed.
* WordPress Installation:
	* Local: 
		* Your site will not be visible to visitors, search engines or anyone else.  It will be 100% private on your computer
		* Need to have local server for wordpress in lical system like ServerPress:
			* ServerPress: DesktopServer software makes your local installation of WordPress as easy as simply giving your site a name and clicking 
			 a few buttons. There is free as well as premium version of DesktopServer available in ServerPress.
			* We need to download free DesktopServer suitable for system and unzip the file and install it. During installation you have an issue if
			  some other software is using port 8080. In that case we need to free up the port and continue with our installation.
			  (we can use ServerPress cports software to find the process running on different ports)
			* Once the ServerPress is installed, we will have DesktopServer.exe file. To start ServerPress we need to run this exe with administrator 
			  priviledge. During starting the server, we need to disable our antivirus as it may prevent us from writing to etc/host file.
			* Then in the wizard, we need give appropriate details and create a new web site. We need to give few details and set username/password for the 
			  wordpress site. Then wordpress will be installed. We can login to get the dashbord.
		* To get login page we can use either /wp-admin or /wp-login in site url.
		* To close the wordpress site, we need to log out of the site and also stop the server. We need to restart DesktopServer.exe(need to turn off antivirus
		  while starting) and visit the site and login.
	* Webhost:
		* When creating website in web host, first thing we need to do is find an available domain. We can do that by coming up with some domain names for 
		  our website and identifying which one is available using Domain Name Analyzer software. It saves time when Brainstorming Domain Names.
		* It is recommended to register with a separate registrar to buy a domain name like goDaddy, nameCheap etc. After getting the domain which cost money
		  and host the website using a web host like heroku, stable host etc. In the web hosting, we need not register the domain with host, but let it use
		  registrar to manage the domain and hosting is managed by the web site.
		* To deploy wordpress in heroku https://ksylvest.com/posts/2014-05-02/deploying-wordpress-to-heroku
	* In cloud9
		* Create wordpress project in cloud9
		* 'mysql-ctl start' to start mysql-ctl
		* select the index.php file and click on run
		* click preview running application to start wordpress.
* Wordpress site has three main areas:
	* Top bar which contains:
		* Workpress - Which contains links to wordpress.org, wordpress forums etc.
		* Our site - which we can open in another tab.
		* Updated
		* comments
		* new button - which can be used to create new post, page , media or user.
		* User - It can be clicked to either edit user profile or logout. 
		* Help - Which provides more detailed help
		* Screen Options: which has various check boxes and it controls what is displayed on main screen, based on what is checked.
	* Side Bar:
		It contains many options and sub options which we can get by clicking/hovering over the options: Some of them are:
		* Dashboard: Which takes to wordpress dashboard which contains the basic details of our webpage at a glance. It also has updates sub options
		  to go updates page.
		* Posts : Create new post, view all post etc
		* Pages
		* Media
		* Users:
		* Comments
		* Appearance
		* Plugins 
	* Main area - which displays the content based on what is selected in the side bar and options checked in screen options.
* Deleting any existing content:
	* If you want to delete pages, posts or comments, we just need to select Pages, Post or Comments from the side bar which will list all Pages, Post and 
	  Comments respectively. We can then remove an induvidual page, post or comment by hovering over them and moving them to trash or selecting all the posts
	  to be deleted and selecting bulk action to move to trash. We can then select trash and empty it or permanantly delete selected item or restore the deleted 
	  item.
	* When a post is deleted all comments associated with it are also deleted.
* WYSIWYG (What You See Is What You Get Editor)
	* This is a great text editor that we get to edit posts/pages. Editing/Adding Posts and Pages are almost similar with WYSIWYG editor.
	* We can click on Post -> Add Post or Select the Post and Edit to get to the editor. 
	* The editor has two view 
		* visual - which is normal view
		* text - which is html view and we can edit the html as well
	* In the visual view we have options make part of text bold, italic, add identation, create bullets or numbered list, add links etc. 
	* We also have 'Add Media' Button on the top, which can be used to add audio, vedio or images. These first needs to uploaded in the media library 
	  from the PC.
	* We can directly add link to you tube vedio and vedio will be added to our page.
* Media Library:
	* Media option has 'library' and 'Add new' sub option. 
	* When we click on Media-> Library we are taken to Media Library which contains list of all media files and we can edit thos files to add caption,
	  alt text for visually impaired and description. For each media file uploaded, there is a separate attachment page is created by wordpress, this page is 
	  also visible to search engines.
	* Media -> Add New, will take us to upload page where we can upload images, audio or vedio by either selecting from our system or dragging and dropping.
* Gravatar: Globally Recognised Avatar
	* Your Gravatar is an image that follows you from site to site appearing beside your name when you do things like comment or post on a blog. Avatars help 
	  identify your posts on blogs and web forums.
	* An "avatar" is an image that represents you online—a little picture that appears next to your name when you interact with websites.
	* A Gravatar is a Globally Recognized Avatar. You upload it and create your profile just once, and then when you participate in any Gravatar-enabled site,
  	  your Gravatar image will automatically follow you there.
	* Gravatar is a free service for site owners, developers, and users. It is automatically included in every WordPress.com
	* We can create a gravatar for the email id associated with wordpress in th Gravatar site and rate it. The differnt ratings are:
		* g - global, pg- possibly offensive , r - adult rated and x - offensive.
	* After setting up your own gravitar we can also edit how our site handles gravatar. We can do this in Setting -> Discussion Setting. There we can select
	  the checkbox to show avatar if present. This will show avatar images of people commenting in our website. We can also select to show only images with 
	  particular rating. It is safe to always choose 'G'. This ensure no offensive image is shown. We can also provide a default icon, if the person commenting 
	  does not have a Gravatar image, but this will take some bandwidth.
* Users :
	* By default when you create a wordpress site, you are added as administator of the site.
	* Edit User Profile:
		* You can go to user profile, either on clicking 'Users->Your Profile' or the username in the top bar. Once in the profile, you can edit the following 
		  info:
			* Disable visual editor. This will disable the 'Visual' mode in WYSIWYG editor.
			* Select the color scheme which you like.
			* Enable keyborad shortcuts
			* Enable Toolbar when we visit the site. This helps to quickly edit the site. But the user needs to logged in to show toolbar.
			* We can also provide FirstName, LastName, email, nickname etc. We can also provide website address and biography which will be displayed in 
			  some themes as about us info.
		* Once the profile is edited, we can click update profile, to save changes and update profile info.
	* New users can added using 'Users -> Add New' from sidebar. We need to provide required info like email and username. We can fill optional info about the
	  user like FirstName, LastName and any website they own. We can also change their password and check the checkbox to send a notification to the user on 
      his account. By default the user is given role of subscriber. We can change this role, by selecting appropriate role from the dropdown. The different
	  roles are:
		* Subscriber: He cannot change content. Just leave comment.
		* Contributer: He can add posts but they are published only after approval.
		* Author : He can add and publish new posts.
		* Editor:
		* Administrator - This role gives all permission and should be given only when absolutely necessary.
* Update Service:
	* Update Services are tools you can use to let other people know you've updated your blog. WordPress automatically notifies popular Update Services that 
	  you've updated your blog by sending a XML-RPC ping each time you create or update a post. In turn, Update Services process the ping and updates their 
	  proprietary indices with your update. Now people browsing sites like Technorati or Sphere can find your most recent posts!
	* Most people use Ping-o-Matic which, with just one "ping" from you, will let many other services know that you've updated.
	* WordPress makes this easy for you by listing Ping-O-Matic's server (rpc.pingomatic.com) by default.If you do not want the update services to be pinged, 
	  remove all the update service URIs listed under "Update Services" on the Settings->Writing administration screen of your WordPress installation.
	  Alternately, you can add list all update services that needs to notified. (https://codex.wordpress.org/Update_Services)
* Reading Settings:
	* Front Page Display: This can be either post or static page. If you select static page, then you can show posts under /Blog path of your site by creating
	  a blank page and setting Post Page to it. Thus in case of static site, we can have Home Page and Posts Page.
	* We can also set the maximum numgber of blogs shown (i.e if set to 10 it will show the latest 10 pages)or maximum of Syndication Feeds.
	* For each article we can either show full text or summary in feed. It is advisable to just show summaries in a feed.
	* We can also discourage search to show our page when it is being developed.
* Discussion Setting:
	* Default article setting - We can notify the sites/articles we link to taht we are referring to their site. This is good practice as they might link back 
	  to you in return. We should turn off our own notification from other sites, as we may get many spams. We can also allow users to comment on our posts.
	* Other Comment Setting like whether user needs to be logged in to leave a comment, and whether user should provide email/username while leaving comment
	  etc can also be set. Also we can the level of nested comment, as well as if we need to split comments across pages. We can also prevent users from
	  commenting on old articles or display newer or older comments on top, based on preference.
	* We can either set all comments for moderation before publishing(this is recommended) or allow user with approved user to publish comments without moderation.
	  We can also set specific comments containing links for moderation. As we set all comments for moderation, we can click on the comments link on the side
	  bar. and look at all pending comment, we can then either aprove comment, move it to trash or spam.
	* We can also add comment blacklist , where we can blacklist certain Ip address, email or cetain words etc.
	* We also have gravatar setting for discussions on this page.
* Permalinks:
	* Permalinks are the permanent URLs to your individual weblog posts, as well as categories and other lists of weblog postings. A permalink is what another 
	  weblogger will use to link to your article (or section), or how you might send a link to your story in an e-mail message. The URL to each post should be
	  permanent, and never change — hence permalink. The default permalink for the weblog post is <url>?p=<page_number>. This is not very informative and we 
	  change the permalink of the post. 
	* Setting-> Permalinks to change the permalink setting, we select from one of the availble like Month/Post Name, Post Name, Post Id etc or create our own 
	  custom link. A number of tags are available to create custom permalink like %year%,  %category%, %author%. A good permalink will be %category%/%postname%
	* We have tag and category pages which lists all the post in the category or tagged with that tag. Those url permalink are <url>/category/<category_name>
	  and <url>/tag/<tag_name>. We can custom structures for your category and tag URLs. For example, using topics as your category base would make your 
	  category links like <url>/topics/<category_name> instead of <url>/category/<category_name>
* Privacy Settings:
	* As a website owner, we  need to follow national or international privacy laws. For example, you may need to create and display a Privacy Policy.	
	  If you already have a Privacy Policy page, please select in Setting -> Privacy. If not, please create one.
	* The new page will include help and suggestions for your Privacy Policy.	However, it is your responsibility to use those resources correctly, to provide 
	  the information that your Privacy Policy requires, and to keep that information current and accurate.
	* After your Privacy Policy page is set, we suggest that you edit it. 
	* We would also review your Privacy Policy from time to time, especially after installing or updating any themes or plugins. There may be changes or new 
	  suggested information for you to consider adding to your policy.
	* The latest version of wordpress adds a link to the privacy policy in the login page.
* Plugins: 
	* Wordpress was built so other developers can create code that can be extend the features of wordpress. This is done through a wordpress feature 
	  called plugins. eg: Contact Form 7( just another contact form plugin. Simple but flexible) , yoast SEO(Yoast SEO does everything in its power to 
	  please both visitors and search engine spiders) etc. There are 1000s of plugins available. There are both free and premium plugins.
	* To install a new plugin we need to go "Plugins -> Add New" and select a plugin from the panel and click on install to install it and activate to activate
	  that plugin. Once Activated the plugin may change the Appearance of the side bar, dashborad etc. eg: On install of 'Yoast SEO' plugin for SEO, some 
      options are added as part of sidebar. 
		* SEO Plugin: On installing and activating 'Yoast SEO', SEO is added to side bar, on click of 'SEO', we get many sub options. 
			* SEO-> General -> Opens SEO dashbord which gives any problems in our site at a glance. It also has features tab that lists various SEO features
			  that can be turned on/off. One such feature of SEO is XML sitemap, which acts as a roadmap of your website which leads Google to all your important 
			  pages. XML sitemaps can be good for SEO, as they allow Google to quickly find your essential website pages, even if your internal linking isn’t 
			  perfect.
			* SEO->Search Apperance -> we can modify configuration if we do not want posts/pages to be visible to search engine by default. If we disable
			  SE visibility, then a meta tag '<meta name="robots" content="noindex,follow"/>' is added so that this page is not shown in search engines. We
			  can set the default SE visibility as well on per page/post basis.
	* We can also buy some plugins. When we buy a plugin we get .zip file. To install this custom premium plugin, we to 'Plugins-> Add New' and click on 
	  'Upload Plugin' button and choose the zip file from local syatem and click on install. Once installed we can activate and use the plugin.
* Widgets:
	* Widgets are independent sections of content that can be placed into widgetised areas provided by your theme (commonly called sidebars). widgetised 
	  areas differ based on the theme. eg: categories, meta info, calender, search bar, text etc.
	* Appearance -> Widgets, takes us to widget dashborad.
	* Wordpress comes pre-installed with a number of widgets.
	* In the widget dashboard, we have preinstalled widgets in the left and widgetised areas or sidebars/footers etc which can contain widgets on right.
	  We can add widgets by dragging and dropping widgets into sidebars, footer etc. We can remove widgets by dragging already placed widgets out of the
	  widgetised area.
	* Widgetised areas on the screen that can contain widgets changes with any change in the wordpress theme.
	* Widgets can be expanded to edit them and customize them.
* Themes:
	* They are the quickest way of changing the look and feel of the website.
	* Appearance-> Themes will take us theme dashborad that contains pre installed themes. We can activate any theme that we need.
	* We can add any new theme from repository using 'Appearance->Themes' -> Add New, select the theme from repository. If we like the theme we can install and 
	  activate the theme.
	* We can buy custom themes, In that case we will get zip file. which we can upload by 'Appearance->Themes' -> Add New -> Upload and selecting the zip
	  file. Then we can install and activate. Once a theme is installed, we can customize it using 'Appearance -> Customize' to change the different
	  parts of theme config, like backgroud images etc. We can look at support doc for each theme to better understand the options available.
	* Once we finalise a theme, we can delete other themes we do not need.
* Posts and Pages:
	When you want to add content to your website, you have two options:
		* Posts:
			* Wordpress was originally designed as a blogging platform. On a traditional blog, there are a lot of posts which are then displayed (often on the
			  homepage) in chronological order with the latest post first. Visitors can see new posts because they are at the top of the page, with
			  older posts lower down. Typical blogs also have a time stamp so you can see the date and time each post was published. Posts are date-dependent 
			  and therefore chronological
			 * Posts were originally designed to be ordered by date, with a post you create today appearing logically above the post you created yesterday.
			   So chronology is one difference between posts and pages.
			 * Posts can be put into category, while pages cannot. Categories help to group related content into a “silo”. If you had a website about body 
			   building, you might write reviews of all the different types of exercise equipment. Doesn’t it make sense to put all of the multi-gyms reviews 
			   into a single multi-gym category? This not only makes sense for a visitor, but it also makes sense for the search engines
			 * Posts can tagged but pages require a plugin to be tagges. Tags are another way to link different pieces of content together. Tags can be used to 
			   further categorise your content to help your visitors and the search engines make sense of your project. 
			 * Posts can have excerpts. Another great feature of posts is that they can have Excerpts. Excerpts are short summaries of a post that you can 
			   create as you add a post to your site. These can be used by the Wordpress theme (and plugins) for a variety of purposes.
			 * Another important feature of posts is that they appear in your site’s RSS feed. 
			 * Posts are designed for the main content of the web site, important pages of the website.
			 * To add a new post we go to 'Posts -> Add New'. We can select all the options from screen options to get all section. We can add post title. As
			   soon as we add title, we get a permalink for that post. We can edit the link if needed. Then we can provide post content using WYSIWYG editor.
			 * On the right side, we have panel containing Publish, where we can save the post as draft or pending review, change the visibility to public or 
			   private, publish it immediately or schedule it to be published on a particular. when we set the date the publish button changes to schedule. 
			   Wordpress will automatically, publish it on the given date. A post is not visible until it is published. 
			 * Below publish section, we have category section where we can select the category for the post. We can add new category or sub category.
			 * We can also add tags to the post. We can add more that one tags to a post.
			 * Some themes allow featured images to be added, when we add an image it appears in the post.
			 * Below WYSIWYG editor, we can SEO config of Yoast SEO for that post.
			 * We can also use excerpts(summary), which are used by some themes which only displays excerpts on the home page. They are also added in meta tag and 
			   read by search engine.
			 * We can enable or diable comment/ping backs for this post. Finally we can publish or schedule the post.
			 * Post Categories:
				* Categories are the main way you organize posts on your Wordpress site. There are very good reasons for organizing posts into categories, both 
				  for your visitors and the search engines.
				* It is good practictice to associate each post to exactly one category.
				* We can edit the category by going to Posts-> Categories. And click on edit button near the category and give name and slug(what appears in url).
				* When you are setting your site up, don’t be afraid to add all of the categories you want to use at the same time. Category pages will only be 
				  created when posts are assigned to the category, so visitors will be totally unaware of any “empty” categories, and search engines won’t see 
				  them either.
			 * Post Tags:
				* We saw that posts can (or should) only be in one category. However, a post can have several tags. Tags are simply words or short phrases that
  				  describe a particular post. Tags are used to describe main feature rather than classify. 
				* Wordpress will create a tag page for EVERY tag you create. 
		* Pages:
			* A page is date-independent and not really related to any other piece of content on the site. 
			* Pages are not dependent on each other and canoot be catogarised.
			* It is possible to create tags for pages as well, but once again, only with plugins. We try not to use plugins unless they are absolutely essential
			  as they do slow down the loading time of a website
			* Pages cannot have excerpts.
			* Pages do not appear in RSS feeds.
			* It is mainly used for legal pages, cotact page, privacy page etc that are really actual content. There are standalone. 
			* Creating a new page is similar to post except there is no tag, category or excerpts in pages.Based on the theme we may have page attributes that
			  we can set.
* Resizing images for adding to web:
	* We need to use graphic designer like photoshop elements, painshop pro etc 
	* First we need to decide where we need to image and whether the picture will full width or half the page size. etc. The we need to use Chrome f12 console
	  to get the actual width in pixel of the image that we need.
	* In the graphic designer, we first crop the image, then resize the image to the required piel width. Then we can save the image for weba nd optimize it 
	  by changing quality etc to lower size to be few kbs.
* Adding social media links to your post:
	* This allows the post to be shared in social media. There are different plugins available for this like 'Social Pug' which is useful plugin.
* Design Home Page:
	* The homepage is the web page that someone visits if they type your domain name into their web browser. Once they get there, the homepage needs to do the 
	  heavy lifting and direct your visitor to the part of the site they want to see. The homepage is arguably the most important page on the site, so you need
	  to get it right.
	* Your homepage needs to be inviting, intuitive and most of all, helpful to someone landing on it. It should allow visitors to easily find what they are 
	  looking for. The homepage is also important for a number of other reasons:
		* It establishes an identity.
		* It helps establish and build trust.
		* It makes a first impression.
		* It’s the place most people go back to on a site to restart a search for something (if the site navigation does not provide them what they want).
		* It shows the visitor the latest content.
	* To create a static home in wordpress. We first need to design a home page. Once designed we can then add that page as home as going to 
	  'Settings->Reading' and changing from page display from posts to a static page and select the home page designed as the front page.
* Contact Forms:
	* Contact forms is good way to let website visitors to contact you. We can have plugins to add contact forms in our page and it will do most the work.
	* Contact Form 7 is good plugin for contact forms. We can install and activate the plugin. It by default creates a sample contact form, And adds a Contact
	  option in the sidebar. We can get a list of all contact forms by clicking on it. Contact form has a shortcode, which we can add on our where we want the
	  contact. It is good preactive to reCaptchas(stating I am not robot checkbox) to avoid spams. We can add by editing the contact form. It requires us
	  to register with google recatcha admin and once we register our site, we get site key and secret key which we may need to provide in 'Contact -> Integration'
	  option. Once the keys are provided we can edit the contact form to add reCaptcha.
	* We can also configure the address where the main will be sent. If we have issues withs ending mail outside the domain, we can use another plugin. This
	  can configured by editing the contact form and on mail tab.
* About Us Page:
	* People are curious by nature and will quite often click onto the “About Us” page to find out more about the site, or person behind the site. On many 
	   sites, the About Us page is one of the top 10
	* The about us can include calls to action, e.g. a newsletter/autoresponder sign up form. You can even recommend a certain page on your site that you think
	  your visitors should visit. It should contain name, photo, website purpose, links to social media etc. Most important of all, About Us pages should not be
	  boring biographies.
	* The other good reason to have an about us page is to “humanize” your blog. Some sites can be very dry, though we are using a Gravatar, so that does help
 	  put a face to the site.
* Legal Pages:
	* We need some legal pages on the site like , terms and condition, privacy page, disclaimer , copywrite notice. These pages can be created by us or we can
	  use a plugin wp-insert, that will craete bare minimum legal pages for us. We can install and activate the wp-insert plugin, it add wp-insert option
	  in the side bar, we can click on it. In the setting we can click on legal page we need to add, it generates page which we edit. We can then assign it 
	  to pre-existing page or let it generate a new page. Once we assign a page, it list in our Pages.
* Custom Menus:
	* We can create custom menus by going to 'Appearance -> MEnus', there we can delete any pre existing menus. We can then create a custom menu conatining
	  links to pages, posts, tags, categories or custom link. We can configure the menu structure, by selecting what pages, posts or links should be part off
	  the menu. We can then edit the title of the link, rearrange the order by dragging and dropping, We can also indent the menu, which will creat sub menus.
	  Once we get the desired menu structure we need to add to a location on a page.
	* The location we can add custom menu to, will depend on the theme and vary from theme to theme. We can go Menu Setting and select the location on the page
	  where the menu should be. We can alternately go to Manage Locations and select from the combo box the location and menu. In the MEnu Setting, we can
	  also auto add new pages to the menu, though it is not recommend.
	* We can edit indivial menu item properties. To get all properties, we can go to 'Screen Option' and display all advanced menu setting. Some of the settings
	  are 'link target'(which lets us open menu in separate tab), link relation(we can make in nofollow so this does come up in SE)
	* If the theme does not provide menu location as our desired location, we can then use 'Cutom menu' widget to add the created menu to desired widgetized 
	  area on the screen. We first need to create the menu from 'Appearance-> Menu' but not select any display location. Then we can to 'Appearance -> widgets'
	  and drag and drop the 'Navigation Menu' widget to the desired widgetised location like footer, sidebar etc.
