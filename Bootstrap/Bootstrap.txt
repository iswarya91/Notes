* Bootstrap is a css, javascript and HTML framework used to design responsive mobile first website really fast.
* It has built in classes which help us build good looking websites and it is highly popular.
* Though lot of websites use bootstrap, they have their own css on top of bootstrap to customize the bootstrap to their liking
* Bootstrap is highly popular due to some of their great features like navbar and grid layout and responsive design.
* It also has very good documentation and extremely simple to get strated. https://getbootstrap.com/
* It is component library as it gives fully developed components.
* Include bootstrap in our project:
	* Download the compiled bootstrap files (css and js) and use them in our project.
	* Use the cdn link for bootsrap and include the links directly in html. CDN contains link to compiled css and js bootraps files. No need to download it 
	locally.
	* We can also download the bootstrap source and compile it locally, but bootstrap uses SASS. Hence SASS compiler is needed to get compiled bootstrap.
* Current bootstrap 4 is the latest major version.
* Some of the commonly used bootstrap components:
	* Buttons: Bootstrap has built in classes to make the button really good looking. These classes can be added to desired button look and feel to
	  button, input and <a> tags.Some of the classes provided for button are:
		* btn - Default bootstrap button class. It needs to added to all buttons to get bootstrap effect.
		Additional classes to control button look and color:
		* btn-primary
		* btn-info
		* btn-secondary
		* btn-danger
		* btn-success
		Button size can be controlled using:
		* btn-lg -large button
		* btn-sm -small button
		* btn-xs - extra small buttons
		There are also some classes that helps us design some button state like:
		* active - This calls adds a eefect as if the button is active
		* disabled - This effect is applied is button is disabled.
	* Form design - Bootstrap provides easy classes to design good looking forms. Some of the important form related classes
		* form-control - This is added to input and select elemnets to get the look and feel provided by bootstrap.
		* form-group - This used to group the label and input together and give some spacing to get better look. This is applied to div 
		  surrounding each label and input.
		* form-inline - This class creates an inline forn rather than block level form.
		* Can provide feedback to user as a div inside form group. The feedback can have following classes
			* valid-feedback -> displayed in green if 'is-valid' class is set on the form input
			* invalid-feedback -> displayed in red if 'is-invalid' class is set on the form input.
	* container - This class is used to create a container and this class is added to a div to give it proper padding and margin to create a 
	  container div.
	* jumbotron - A lightweight, flexible component that can optionally extend the entire viewport to showcase key marketing messages on your site. It
	  is created by adding class jumbotron. It occupies the full width of its parent.
	* Navigation bar: One of the most popular and widely used component of bootstrap is navigation bar. Bootstrap provides simple and highly responsive 
	  easy to design navigation bar. Various components can be added as part of navigation bar. Brand , Link on th eleft, Links on the right (like SignIn ,
	  LogIn etc), inline form (serach bar) , dropdowns etc.
		* To add a default nav bar we apply classes 'navbar' and 'navbar-default' to the nav html component.
		* Once navbar is added we can add brand name or image using 'navbar-brand' . This can be done inside a div with 'navbar-header' class.
		* To create navigation link 'nav navbar-nav' classes are applied to <div> or <ul> containing list of links.
		* To create navigation links on the right 'nav navbar-nav navbar-right' classes are applied to the <ul>
		* To make navbar responsive, for mobile and tablet views we may have to hide the links and create hamburger button, on click of which links 
		  should be displayed). As this involves interactivity bootstrap.js file needs to included using <script> tag in our html.
		* boostrap.js require jquery. Hence link to jquery also needs to be added to html befor adding link to bootstrap.js.
		* To hide the links, the content that needs to added is placed inside a div with classes 'collapse navbar-collapse' and an id.
		* To get the hidden div on click of hamburger, we first need to add the hamburger button on the navbar-header. It actually consists of three 
		 spans with class 'icon-bar' applied ( One for each bar in the hamburger icon). In bootstrap 4 we have a single span with 'navbar-toggler-icon'
		 to create the hamburger button. Thus we need to refer to bootstrap docs to get the required classes to create a navbar.
		 The button has some important attribute:
			* data-target -'#<id>' - It should point to the id of the div containing the elements that need to collapsed.
		* Thus we can have a simple responsive navbar with few classes. We need not memorise all the classes but simply use them after looking at example in 
		  https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0/components/navbar/
	* Bootstrap grid Layout: It is the most popular feature as it gives us a simple way to layout responsive webapges in the grid. It is mobile-first flexbox 
	  grid to build layouts of all shapes and sizes thanks to a twelve column system, five default responsive tiers, Sass variables and mixins, and dozens of 
	  predefined classes.
		* We can create a great grid structure using rows and columns. A row should always wrap a column. The following bootstrap classes can be applied to the 
		  grid.
			* row -> This creates a row that can be divided into 12 columns. To create two columns we can create two divs inside row with col-lg-6. 
			* There are five different sizes available for columns, these are applied for different devices
				* extra large - col-xl
				* large - col-lg
				* medium - col-md
				* small - col-sm
				* extra small -> col(bootstrap 4), col-xs( bootstrap 3)
			* Thus a highly responsive grid can be obtained by using diffent layout for different sizes. Consider the case where the divs need to stack one 
			  after another in mobiles, but take 50% in md devices and 25% in large and extra large devices.
				eg: <div class="row">
						<div class="col-md-3 col-sm-6 blue">FUN1</div>
						<div class="col-md-3 col-sm-6 blue">FUN2</div>
						<div class="col-md-3 col-sm-6 blue">FUN3</div>
						<div class="col-md-3 col-sm-6 blue">FUN4</div>
					</div>
					Thus it will take 25% in  md and larger devices and 50% in sm to medium and 100% in extra samll devices.
			* Grid can be nested within one another. To do that another row is added as a child of column. This can further be divided into 12 columns. Button
			 the columns must always be child to row divs.
	* Adding Icons: Before bootstrap4 , glyphicons was part of bootstrap. Bootstrap includes 260 glyphs from the Glyphicon Halflings set. Glyphicons Halflings are 
	  normally not available for free, but their creator has made them available for Bootstrap free of cost. As a thank you, you should include a link back to 
	  Glyphicons whenever possible.It gives a set of icons that can easily be added to boostrap corresponding glyphicon classes.
		* <p>Envelope icon: <span class="glyphicon glyphicon-envelope"></span></p> 
		* <p>Search icon: <span class="glyphicon glyphicon-search"></span></p>
	  From Bootstrap4 , Glyphicons are no longer part of bootstrap and need to be separately bought and used. Alternately other free icons like Font Awesome,
	  which has a very good collection of free icons can be used. Font Awesome can be used by getting a corresponding css class and using appropriate
	  classes in <i> tag.
	* Thumbnail: It is used to create thumbnail containers before bootstrap 4. After bootstrap4 this is deprecated and replaced  by flexbox implementation 
	 container called 'card'
	* margin: In bootstrap we can add margins using following:
		mt -> margin-top. We have values like mt-1, mt-2, mt-3 etc which adds a fixed value in rem(mt-1 is 0.25rem, mt-2 is 0.5 etc) to the top margin 
		ml -> margin left
		mr -> margin-right
		mb -> margin-bootom
		mx-auto -> adds auto margin to left and right margin thus centering the element.
	* padding & border
		* pt, pb, pl, pr are for padding top, bottom, left and right. px for left and right padding & py for top & bottom padding.
		* bt, bb, bl, br are for border top, bottom, left and right.
	* card - Used to create a card in bootstrap
	* badge - Used to create badges in bootstrap
	 
* Bootswatch - Free themes for Bootstrap
